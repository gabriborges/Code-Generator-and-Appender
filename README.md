Code Generator and Appender

Let's assume you have a code that gives you 10 dollars in a certain online service, but the code is missing some characters and you have to try every possible letter
and number do find the right code.
This Code Generator and Appender generates codes based on the base code you give and return a file with every single possible code you can try and find the right one.

A script that puts the codes automatically on the box text is being worked latter on.
